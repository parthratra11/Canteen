# FoodEase: Streamlining Campus Dining Operations through Digital Solutions

The FoodEase is an innovative solution designed to streamline the food ordering process. This application addresses the common issue of overcrowding in canteens by allowing students to place orders directly from their smartphones. By eliminating the need to queue for tokens and then wait for food, our system enhances the overall dining experience, reduces wait times, and minimizes congestion.

## Features
* **Easy Outlets Registration:** Colleges can register their cafeterias/outlets on our platform and provide details about the food offerings and prices.
* **Seamless Ordering:** Students can browse the menu, place orders, and specify their table number or name directly from their smartphones.
* **Real-Time Updates:** The app provides real-time updates on order status, including the last order number delivered and estimated time for the current order.
* **Personalized Recommendations:** Using machine learning algorithms, the app offers personalized food recommendations based on past data.
* **Efficient Delivery:** Orders are delivered directly to the studentâ€™s table, eliminating the need for multiple queues.
